         Sonnet 130:<br>
         My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun

      <p>
         My mistress&#39; eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
         Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
         If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
         If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
         I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
         But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
         And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
         Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
         I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
         That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
         I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
         My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.<br>
            And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
            As any she belied with false compare.<br>
