         Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
         And sorry I could not travel both<br>
         And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
         And looked down one as far as I could<br>
         To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
      </p>
      <p>
         Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
         And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
         Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
         Though as for that the passing there<br>
         Had worn them really about the same,<br>
      </p>
      <p>
         And both that morning equally lay<br>
         In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
         Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
         Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
         I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
         I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
         Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
         Two roads diverged in a wood, and I &#8211;<br>
         I took the one less traveled by,<br>
         And that has made all the difference.<br>
